= Flourish for Composer

Idea is to port it to fully working package for [[http://getcomposer.org/|Composer]],  while (fully?) adhering to [[https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md|PSR_0]] specification.

Warning: Alpha version, dragons ahead(this means not production ready)!! 

== TODO:
 * Tests (travis support)
 * Classes with static typed function declarations (add Flourish namespace)
